# **Meta-Model Graphs with R-GCN Implementation**

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of **Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCN)** for meta-model graph structures. It is tailored for **Model-Driven Engineering (MDE)** applications, where model elements, attributes, and references are transformed into graph representations for advanced graph-based machine learning tasks.
